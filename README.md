**Korea Stablecoin Hackathon 2025 - KRW Stablecoin Ideathon Track**

**Vision:** To build the foundational payment infrastructure for the global K-culture economy, powered by a KRW Stablecoin.

## About Manna

Manna (만나) is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize how global fans support Korean creators (webtoon artists, musicians, streamers, educators). By leveraging a KRW Stablecoin (KRW-S), Manna enables instant, transparent, and low-cost direct financial transfers, solving the pervasive issues of high fees, slow settlements, and lack of transparency in cross-border payments.

This repository contains the proof-of-concept (PoC) for **Phase 1** of our vision, demonstrating the core fan-to-creator tipping functionality. While this prototype is focused, it is the first step in a much larger, multi-phase roadmap.
