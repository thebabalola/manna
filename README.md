## About Manna

Manna (만나) is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize how global fans support Korean creators (webtoon artists, musicians, streamers, educators). By leveraging a KRW Stablecoin (KRW-S), Manna enables instant, transparent, and low-cost direct financial transfers, solving the pervasive issues of high fees, slow settlements, and lack of transparency in cross-border payments.

This repository contains the proof-of-concept (PoC) for **Phase 1** of our vision, demonstrating the core fan-to-creator tipping functionality. While this prototype is focused, it is the first step in a much larger, multi-phase roadmap.

## Our Long-Term Roadmap

Manna's journey unfolds in three strategic phases:

- **Phase 1: Launch Manna (Direct Creator Bridge):** Perfect direct fan-to-creator funding, proving the immediate utility of KRW-S.
- **Phase 2: Build the K-Culture Ecosystem:** Expand into merchandise, digital goods, event ticketing, and gaming integrations.
- **Phase 3: The KRW-S Super-App:** Evolve into a universal payment and loyalty network for the broader Korean economy, including retail and tourism.
